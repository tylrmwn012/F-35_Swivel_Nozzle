# F-35 Swivel Nozzle

This project utilizes an Arduino board, servos, and rotary encoders 
to form a functioning F-35 Swivel Nozzle with 3 pivot points.

The goal of this side project is to expand my knowledge on embedded 
programming, while also dive into a project that can be improved upon
over time.

Currently, the code utilizes the 3 pivot points as expected. Next is
testing the code on an actual arduino with components.
